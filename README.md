I need to find a way to commit meaningful work while I'm here

what can I do to accomplish this?

the basic best option would be to set up my chromebok and build the react, js, and non-meteor stuff separately, and do integration tests at home!

this makes the most sense

the other trick is getting good food at work to keep my energy up

protein bars are no longer an option

that or BIG breakfasts? tricky

the long days on Tuesdays and Wednesdays are the best by far


The trick with react will be creating a language for describing UI elements in the context of a game
each system module will need to be able to create custom prompts from available components
thus, we need a set of components that can apply

Basics:

Displaying numbers
- progress bar
- field

Editing numbers
- slider bar
- field with incrementors
  - modifier versus score
- field with typability
  - field validation

Non numerical
- field (text)
- image
- file
- what else?
  - limited list (e.g. d4, d6, etc)
  - limited with custom list (e.g. creature type, because some types are GM custom but some ar
  - a tag (a la PF2) (same as a limited list, or limited with custom, really)


Thus, the main engine has an understanding of what components are available, and the UI modules have corresponding logic for each field type

we need a better word than field or component
game element?
let's call it a figure

A figure could be a creature's name, a score, a modifier, a die type, etc

that's great! so each rule has a field for "figure" as for
